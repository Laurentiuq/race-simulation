## Introduction
Welcome to the Car Racing Game! This game offers an exciting racing experience with multiple scenes and maps. Challenge yourself against AI-controlled cars that navigate the track using the A* pathfinding algorithm.

## Features
- Two distinct game scenes.
- Two unique maps with different terrains and challenges.
- AI-controlled cars using A* algorithm for pathfinding.
- User-friendly controls and interface.
- Dynamic gameplay with varying difficulty levels.


Controls
Arrow Keys: Steer the car (Up to accelerate, Down to brake, Left and Right to turn).
Spacebar: Handbrake.
P: Pause the game.
R: Restart the race.
Game Scenes
Scene 1: Near Mountain Track
Race through a scenic mountain track with steep climbs, sharp descents, and breathtaking views. Master the art of navigating tight turns and elevation changes.

Scene 2: Urban Uproar
Navigate through a bustling cityscape with tight corners, traffic, and unexpected obstacles. Perfect your timing and control to come out on top.

Maps
Map 1: Canyon Circuit
A winding track set in a canyon with elevation changes and narrow passages. Master the art of drifting to maintain speed through the curves.

Map 2: Downtown Drift
A fast-paced urban track with long straights and sharp corners. Utilize your braking and acceleration skills to navigate through the city streets.

AI Implementation
The game features AI-controlled cars that use the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate the track. The A* algorithm ensures that the AI cars find the optimal path around the track while avoiding obstacles and other cars. This creates a challenging and dynamic racing experience for the player.

A* Pathfinding Algorithm
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in various applications, including games. It combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First-Search to find the most efficient path. In this game, the A* algorithm is used to:

Determine the shortest path around the track.
Avoid obstacles and other cars.
Adjust the AI car's speed and direction in real-time.
